Although most integrons were initially described in human clinical isolates, they have now been identified in many non-clinical environments, such as water and soil. Integrons are present in ≈10\% of the sequenced bacterial genomes and are frequently linked to mobile genetic elements (MGEs); particularly the class 1 integrons. Genetic linkage to a diverse set of MGEs facilitates horizontal transfer of class 1 integrons within and between bacterial populations and species. The mechanistic aspects limiting transfer of MGEs will therefore limit the transfer of class 1 integrons. However, horizontal movement due to genes provided in trans and homologous recombination can result in class 1 integron dynamics independent of MGEs. A key determinant for continued dissemination of class 1 integrons is the probability that transferred MGEs will be vertically inherited in the recipient bacterial population. Heritability depends both on genetic stability as well as the fitness costs conferred to the host. Here we review the factors known to govern the dissemination of class 1 integrons in bacteria.},

              Phage regulatory switches (phage-RSs) are a newly described form of active lysogeny where prophages function as regulatory mechanisms for expression of chromosomal bacterial genes. In
              Staphylococcus aureus
              , ϕSa3int is a widely distributed family of prophages that integrate into the β-toxin structural gene
              hlb
              , effectively inactivating it. However, β-toxin-producing strains often arise during infections and are more virulent in experimental infective endocarditis and pneumonia infections. We present evidence that in
              S. aureus
              MW2, ϕSa3mw excision is temporally and differentially responsive to growth conditions relevant to
              S. aureus
              pathogenesis. PCR analyses of ϕSa3mw (integrated and excised) and of intact
              hlb
              showed that ϕSa3mw preferentially excises in response to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress and during biofilm growth. ϕSa3mw remains as a prophage when in contact with human aortic endothelial cells in culture. A criterion for a prophage to be considered a phage-RS is the inability to lyse host cells. MW2 grown under phage-inducing conditions did not release infectious phage particles by plaque assay or transmission electron microscopy, indicating that ϕSa3mw does not carry out a productive lytic cycle. These studies highlight a dynamic, and perhaps more sophisticated,
              S. aureus
              -prophage interaction where ϕSa3int prophages provide a novel regulatory mechanism for the conditional expression of virulence factors.
            
            
              IMPORTANCE
              β-Toxin is a sphingomyelinase hemolysin that significantly contributes to
              Staphylococcus aureus
              pathogenesis. In most
              S. aureus
              isolates the prophage ϕSa3int inserts into the β-toxin gene
              hlb
              , inactivating it, but human and experimental infections give rise to β-toxin-producing variants. However, it remained to be established whether ϕSa3mw excises in response to specific environmental cues, restoring the β-toxin gene sequence. This is not only of fundamental interest but also critical when designing intervention strategies and therapeutics. We provide evidence that ϕSa3mw actively excises, allowing the conditional expression of β-toxin. ϕSa3int prophages may play a novel and largely uncharacterized role in
              S. aureus
              pathogenesis as molecular regulatory switches that promote bacterial fitness and adaptation to the challenges presented by the mammalian host.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            
              Strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, particularly those that are multiresistant, are an increasing major health care problem around the world. It is now abundantly clear that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are able to meet the evolutionary challenge of combating antimicrobial chemotherapy, often by acquiring preexisting resistance determinants from the bacterial gene pool. This is achieved through the concerted activities of mobile genetic elements able to move within or between DNA molecules, which include insertion sequences, transposons, and gene cassettes/integrons, and those that are able to transfer between bacterial cells, such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Together these elements play a central role in facilitating horizontal genetic exchange and therefore promote the acquisition and spread of resistance genes. This review aims to outline the characteristics of the major types of mobile genetic elements involved in acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, focusing on the so-called ESKAPEE group of organisms (

Significant correlations occur in the ECOR strains in the presence or absence of unrelated insertion sequences in the chromosome and plasmid complements. Strains containing any insertion sequence are more likely to contain additional, unrelated insertion sequences than would be expected by chance. We suggest that the positive correlations result from horizontal transfer mediated by plasmids. A branching-process model for the plasmid-mediated transmission of insertion sequences among hosts yields such a correlation, even in the absence of interactions affecting transposition or fitness. The predictions of the model are quantitatively in agreement with the observed correlations among insertion sequences.},

	abstract = {Plasmid invasion in biofilms is often surprisingly limited in spite of the close contact of cells in a biofilm. We hypothesized that this poor plasmid spread into deeper biofilm layers is caused by a dependence of conjugation on the growth rate (relative to the maximum growth rate) of the donor. By extending an individual-based model of microbial growth and interactions to include the dynamics of plasmid carriage and transfer by individual cells, we were able to conduct in silico tests of this and other hypotheses on the dynamics of conjugal plasmid transfer in biofilms. For a generic model plasmid, we find that invasion of a resident biofilm is indeed limited when plasmid transfer depends on growth, but not so in the absence of growth dependence. Using sensitivity analysis we also find that parameters related to timing (i.e. a lag before the transconjugant can transfer, transfer proficiency and scan speed) and spatial reach (EPS yield, conjugal pilus length) are more important for successful plasmid invasion than the recipients' growth rate or the probability of segregational loss. While this study identifies one factor that can limit plasmid invasion in biofilms, the new individual-based framework introduced in this work is a powerful tool that enables one to test additional hypotheses on the spread and role of plasmids in microbial biofilms.},

In harsh environments, bacterial populations adapt by sampling genetic material from a horizontal gene pool through self-transmissible plasmids, and that allows persistence of these mobile genetic elements. In the absence of selection for plasmid-encoded traits it is not well understood if and how plasmids persist in bacterial communities. Here we present three models of the dynamics of plasmid persistence in the absence of selection. The models consider plasmid loss (segregation), plasmid cost, conjugative plasmid transfer, and observation error. Also, we present a stochastic model in which the relative fitness of the plasmid-free cells was modeled as a random variable affected by an environmental process using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Extensive simulations showed that the estimates from the proposed model are nearly unbiased. Likelihood-ratio tests showed that the dynamics of plasmid persistence are strongly dependent on the host type. Accounting for stochasticity was necessary to explain four of seven time-series data sets, thus confirming that plasmid persistence needs to be understood as a stochastic process. This work can be viewed as a conceptual starting point under which new plasmid persistence hypotheses can be tested.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantitative models of bacterial conjugation are useful tools in environmental risk assessment and in studies of the ecology and evolution of bacterial communities. We constructed a mathematical model for gene transfer between bacteria growing on a solid surface. The model considers that donor and recipient cells will form separate colonies, which grow exponentially until nutrient exhaustion. Conjugation occurs when donor and recipient colonies meet, all recipient cells becoming transconjugants instantly, after which they act as donors. The model was tested theoretically by computer simulations that followed the histories of individual bacterial colonies and was validated for initial surface coverage of 60\% or less, where confluent growth does not occur. Model predictions of final number of donors, recipients and transconjugants were tested experimentally using a filter mating system with two isogenic strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens MON787 acting as donor and recipient of plasmid RP4. Experimental trends resulting from varying donor and recipient inoculum numbers and donor:recipient ratios were well described by the model, although it often overestimated conjugation by 0.5-2 orders of magnitude. Predictions were greatly improved, generally to within half a log unit of experimental values, by consideration of the time for conjugative transfer. The model demonstrates the relationship between spatial separation of cells and nutrient availability on numbers of transconjugants. By providing a mechanistic approach to the study conjugation on surfaces, the model may contribute to the study of gene transfer in natural environments.},

	abstract = {Bacterial plasmids are extra-chromosomal genetic elements that code for a wide variety of phenotypes in their bacterial hosts and are maintained in bacterial communities through both vertical and horizontal transfer. Current mathematical models of plasmid-bacteria dynamics, based almost exclusively on mass-action differential equations that describe these interactions in completely mixed environments, fail to adequately explain phenomena such as the long-term persistence of plasmids in natural and clinical bacterial communities. This failure is, at least in part, due to the absence of any spatial structure in these models, whereas most bacterial populations are spatially structured in microcolonies and biofilms. To help bridge the gap between theoretical predictions and observed patterns of plasmid spread and persistence, an individual-based lattice model (interacting particle system) that provides a predictive framework for understanding the dynamics of plasmid-bacteria interactions in spatially structured populations is presented here. To assess the accuracy and flexibility of the model, a series of experiments that monitored plasmid loss and horizontal transfer of the IncP-1beta plasmid pB10 : : rfp in Escherichia coli K12 and other bacterial populations grown on agar surfaces were performed. The model-based visual patterns of plasmid loss and spread, as well as quantitative predictions of the effects of different initial parental strain densities and incubation time on densities of transconjugants formed on a 2D grid, were in agreement with this and previously published empirical data. These results include features of spatially structured populations that are not predicted by mass-action differential equation models.},

To test this hypothesis, the population dynamics of two laboratory and five naturally occurring conjugative plasmids were examined in chemostat cultures of E. coli K-12. Both laboratory plasmids and three of the five wild plasmids failed to increase in frequency when introduced at low frequencies. However, two of the naturally occurring plasmids rapidly increased in frequency, and bacteria carrying them achieved dominance in the absence of selection for known plasmid-borne genes. Three hypotheses for the invasion and persistence of these two plasmids were examined. It is concluded that although these two extrachromosomal genetic elements are repressed for conjugative pili synthesis, as a consequence of high rates of transfer during periods of transitory derepression in newly formed transconjugants, they become established and are maintained by infectious transfer alone. The implications of these observations to the theory of plasmid maintenance and the evolution of repressible conjugative pili synthesis are discussed.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the factors that govern plasmid transfers in natural ecosystems such as the gut. The consistent finding by earlier workers that plasmid transfer in the normal gut can be detected only at very low rates, if at all, has given rise to numerous speculations concerning the presence in vivo of various inhibitors of plasmid transfer. Plasmids R1, R1drd-19, and pBR322 were studied in Escherichia coli K-12 and wild-type E. coli hosts in two experimental systems: (i) gnotobiotic mice carrying a synthetic indigenous microflora (F-strains) which resemble in their function the normal indigenous microflora of the mouse large intestine, and (ii) anaerobic continuous-flow cultures of indigenous large intestinal microflora of the mouse, which can simulate bacterial interactions observed in the mouse gut. Mathematical models were developed to estimate plasmid transfer rates as a measure of the "fertility," i.e., of the intrinsic ability to transfer the plasmid under the environmental conditions of the gut. The models also evaluate the effects of plasmid segregation, reduction of the growth rates of plasmid-bearing bacterial hosts, repression of transfer functions, competition for nutrients, and bacterial attachment to the wall of the gut or culture vessel. Some confidence in the validity of these mathematical models was gained because they were able to reproduce a number of known phenomena such as the repression of fertility of the R1 plasmid, as well as known differences in the transmission and mobilization of the plasmids studied. Interpretation of the data obtained permitted a number of conclusions, some of which were rather unexpected. (i) Fertility of plasmid-bearing E. coli in the normal intestine was not impaired. The observed low rates of plasmid transfer in the normal gut can be explained on quantitative grounds alone and do not require hypothetical inhibitory mechanisms. (ii) Conditions for long-term spread and maintenance throughout human or animal populations of a diversity of conjugative and nonconjugative plasmids may be optimal among E. coli strains of low fertility, as are found among wild-type strains. (iii) E. coli strains carrying plasmid pBR322 plus R1drd-19 were impaired in their ability to transfer R1drd-19, but strains carrying pBR322 were significantly better recipients of R1drd-19 than a plasmid-free recipient E. coli. (iv) Long-term coexistence of plasmid-bearing and plasmid-free E. coli, in spite of undiminished fertility, appeared to be due to a detrimental effect of the plasmid on the growth rate of its host bacterium, rather than due to high rates of plasmid segregation. (v) Mathematical analysis of experimental data published by earlier investigators is consistent with the conclusion that plasmid transfer occurs consistently in the human gut, but that the resulting transconjugant E. coli populations are too small to be detected regularly with the culture methods used by earlier investigators. It is concluded that the long-term interactions observed were often the consequences of minor differences in parameters such as growth rates, fertility, rates of segregation, etc., which were too small to be detected except by precise mathematical analysis of long-term experiments, but which were nevertheless decisive determinants of the ultimate fates of the plasmids and their hosts.},

The results of this analysis demonstrate the existence of conditions where, as a consequence of infectious transmission via mobilization, nonconjugative plasmids could become established and be maintained even when the bacteria carrying them have lower reproductive fitnesses than plasmid-free members of the population. However, these existence conditions are stringent and suggest therefore, that it is highly unlikely that plasmids of this type would become established and maintained without some direct selection favoring their carriage. The general implications of these results and limitations of the model are discussed.

In the analysis of the properties of this model, primary consideration is given to the conditions under which these nonself-transmissible extrachromosomal elements could become established and would be maintained in bacterial populations. The results of this analysis demonstrate the existence of conditions where, as a consequence of infectious transmission via mobilization, nonconjugative plasmids could become established and be maintained even when the bacteria carrying them have lower reproductive fitnesses than plasmid-free members of the population. However, these existence conditions are stringent and suggest therefore, that it is highly unlikely that plasmids of this type would become established and maintained without some direct selection favoring their carriage. The general implications of these results and limitations of the model are discussed. Brief consideration is also given to the implications of these theoretical findings to the problems of the spread of multiple antibiotic resistance plasmids (R-factors) and the risk of contaminating natural populations of bacteria with chimeric plasmids produced by work with recombinant DNA.},

Consideration is given to nonbacteriocinogenic factors that are incapable of incorporation into the chromosome of their host cells, and to bacterial populations maintained in either continuous (chemostat) or discrete (serial transfer) culture. The conditions for the establishment and maintenance of these infectious extrachromosomal elements and equilibrium frequencies of cells carrying them are presented for different values of the biological parameters: population growth functions, conjugational transfer and segregation rate constants. With these parameters in a biologically realistic range, the theory predicts a broad set of physical conditions, resource concentrations and dilution rates, where conjugationally transmitted plasmids can become established and where cells carrying them will maintain high frequencies in bacterial populations. This can occur even when plasmid-bearing cells are much less fit (i.e., have substantially lower growth rates) than cells free of these factors. The implications of these results and the reality and limitations of the model are discussed and the values of its parameters in natural populations speculated upon.},

	abstract = {beta-Lactamases are the commonest single cause of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Numerous chromosomal and plasmid-mediated types are known and may be classified by their sequences or phenotypic properties. The ability of a beta-lactamase to cause resistance varies with its activity, quantity, and cellular location and, for gram-negative organisms, the permeability of the producer strain. beta-Lactamases sometimes cause obvious resistance to substrate drugs in routine tests; often, however, these enzymes reduce susceptibility without causing resistance at current, pharmacologically chosen breakpoints. This review considers the ability of the prevalent beta-lactamases to cause resistance to widely used beta-lactams, whether resistance is accurately reflected in routine tests, and the extent to which the antibiogram for an organism can be used to predict the type of beta-lactamase that it produces.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2180-2-35},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1982 Smith and Huggins showed that bacteriophages could be at least as effective as antibiotics in preventing mortality from experimental infections with a capsulated E. coli (K1) in mice. Phages that required the K1 capsule for infection were more effective than phages that did not require this capsule, but the efficacies of phages and antibiotics in preventing mortality both declined with time between infection and treatment, becoming virtually ineffective within 16 hours.
RESULTS: We develop quantitative microbiological procedures that (1) explore the in vivo processes responsible for the efficacy of phage and antibiotic treatment protocols in experimental infections (the Resistance Competition Assay, or RCA), and (2) survey the therapeutic potential of phages in vitro (the Phage Replication Assay or PRA). We illustrate the application and utility of these methods in a repetition of Smith and Huggins' experiments, using the E. coli K1 mouse thigh infection model, and applying treatments of phages or streptomycin.
CONCLUSIONS: 1) The Smith and Huggins phage and antibiotic therapy results are quantitatively and qualitatively robust. (2) Our RCA values reflect the microbiological efficacies of the different phages and of streptomycin in preventing mortality, and reflect the decline in their efficacy with a delay in treatment. These results show specifically that bacteria become refractory to treatment over the term of infection. (3) The K1-specific and non-specific phages had similar replication rates on bacteria grown in broth (based on the PRA), but the K1-specific phage had markedly greater replication rates in mouse serum.},

	abstract = {Felix D'Herelle coined the term bacteriophage in 1917 to characterize a hypothetical viral agent responsible for the mysterious phenomenon of rapid bacterial death. While the viral nature of the "phage" was only widely accepted in the 1940s, attempts to use the phenomenon in treating infections started early. After raising hopes in the interwar years, by 1945 phage therapy had been abandoned almost entirely in the West, until the recent revival of interest in response to the crisis of antibiotic resistance. The use of phage therapy, however, persisted within Soviet medicine, especially in Georgia. This article explains the adoption and survival of phage therapy in the USSR. By focusing on the Tbilisi Institute of Microbiology, Epidemiology and Bacteriophage (now the Eliava Institute), I argue that bacteriophage research appealed to Soviet scientists because it offered an ecological model for understanding bacterial infection. In the 1930s, phage therapy grew firmly imbedded within the infrastructure of Soviet microbiological institutes. During the Second World War, bacteriophage preparations gained practical recognition from physicians and military authorities. At the dawn of the Cold War, the growing scientific isolation of Soviet science protected phage therapy from the contemporary western critiques, and the ecological program of research into bacteriophages continued in Georgia.},

	abstract = {Viruses of microbes impact all ecosystems where microbes drive key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans, humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms or genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing. Here, we present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral signal in these different types of microbial sequence data in both a reference-dependent and reference-independent manner, leveraging probabilistic models and extensive virome data to maximize detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows that VirSorter's prophage prediction capability compares to that of available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and metagenomic datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled sequence (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect identification ({\textgreater}95\% Recall and 100\% Precision) on contigs of at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it can also be used in "reverse" to more confidently identify viral sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a web-based user interface interconnected with the required computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing prophage prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG and metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse ecosystems.},

            PHAST (PHAge Search Tool) and its successor PHASTER (PHAge Search Tool – enhanced Release) have become two of the most widely used web servers for identifying putative prophages in bacterial genomes. Here we review the main capabilities of these web resources, provide some practical guidance regarding their use and discuss possible future improvements. PHAST, which was first described in 2011, made its debut just as whole bacterial genome sequencing and was becoming inexpensive and relatively routine. PHAST quickly gained popularity among bacterial genome researchers because of its web accessibility, its ease of use along with its enhanced accuracy and rapid processing times. PHASTER, which appeared in 2016, provided a number of much-needed enhancements to the PHAST server, including greater processing speed (to cope with very large submission volumes), increased database sizes, a more modern user interface, improved graphical displays and support for metagenomic submissions. Continuing developments in the field, along with increased interest in automated phage and prophage finding, have already led to several improvements to the PHASTER server and will soon lead to the development of a successor to PHASTER (to be called PHASTEST).},

Fifty-one of the 82 such genomes published to date carry prophages, and these contain 230 recognizable putative prophages. Prophages can constitute as much as 10-20\% of a bacterium's genome and are major contributors to differences between individuals within species. Many of these prophages appear to be defective and are in a state of mutational decay. Prophages, including defective ones, can contribute important biological properties to their bacterial hosts. Therefore, if we are to comprehend bacterial genomes fully, it is essential that we are able to recognize accurately and understand their prophages from nucleotide sequence analysis. Analysis of the evolution of prophages can shed light on the evolution of both bacteriophages and their hosts. Comparison of the Rac prophages in the sequenced genomes of three Escherichia coli strains and the Pnm prophages in two Neisseria meningitidis strains suggests that some prophages can lie in residence for very long times, perhaps millions of years, and that recombination events have occurred between related prophages that reside at different locations in a bacterium's genome. In addition, many genes in defective prophages remain functional, so a significant portion of the temperate bacteriophage gene pool resides in prophages.},

	abstract = {This study considers gene location within bacteria as a function of genetic element mobility. Our emphasis is on prophage encoding of bacterial virulence factors (VFs). At least four mechanisms potentially contribute to phage encoding of bacterial VFs: (i) Enhanced gene mobility could result in greater VF gene representation within bacterial populations. We question, though, why certain genes but not others might benefit from this mobility. (ii) Epistatic interactionsbetween VF genes and phage genes that enhance VF utility to bacteriacould maintain phage genes via selection acting on individual, VF-expressing bacteria. However, is this mechanism sufficient to maintain the rest of phage genomes or, without gene co-regulation, even genetic linkage between phage and VF genes? (iii) Phage could amplify VFs during disease progression by carrying them to otherwise commensal bacteria colocated within the same environment. However, lytic phage kill bacteria, thus requiring assumptions of inclusive fitness within bacterial populations to explain retention of phage-mediated VF amplification for the sake of bacterial utility. Finally, (iv) phage-encoded VFs could enhance phage Darwinian fitness, particularly by acting as ecosystem-modifying agents. That is, VF-supplied nutrients could enhance phage growth by increasing the density or by improving the physiology of phage-susceptible bacteria. Alternatively, VF-mediated break down of diffusion-inhibiting spatial structure found within the multicellular bodies of host organisms could augment phage dissemination to new bacteria or to environments. Such phage-fitness enhancing mechanisms could apply particularly given VF expression within microbiologically heterogeneous environments, ie, ones where phage have some reasonable potential to acquire phage-susceptible bacteria.},

Phage {{{DNA}}} may also constitute 20\% of bacterial genomes; however, its role is ill defined. Here, we explore the impact of cryptic prophages on cell physiology by precisely deleting all nine prophage elements (166?kbp) using Escherichia coli. We find that cryptic prophages contribute significantly to resistance to sub-lethal concentrations of quinolone and ß-lactam antibiotics primarily through proteins that inhibit cell division (for example, KilR of rac and DicB of Qin). Moreover, the prophages are beneficial for withstanding osmotic, oxidative and acid stresses, for increasing growth, and for influencing biofilm formation. Prophage CPS-53 proteins YfdK, YfdO and YfdS enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, prophages e14, CPS-53 and CP4-57 increased resistance to acid, and e14 and rac proteins increased early biofilm formation. Therefore, cryptic prophages provide multiple benefits to the host for surviving adverse environmental conditions., Up to 20\% of bacterial genomes are made up of cryptic prophages, but their function is relatively unknown. In this study, the authors demonstrate that prophages influence the response of the host cell to stress and provide a competitive growth advantage in the presence of antibiotics.},

The distribution of prophages with respect to presence or absence in a given bacterial species, the location and orientation of the prophages on the replichore was not homogeneous. In bacterial pathogens, prophages are particularly prominent. They frequently encoded virulence genes and were major contributors to the genetic individuality of the strains. However, some commensal and free-living bacteria also showed prominent prophage contributions to the bacterial genomes. Lysogens containing multiple sequence-related prophages can experience rearrangements of the bacterial genome across prophages, leading to prophages with new gene constellations. Transfer RNA genes are the preferred chromosomal integration sites, and a number of prophages also carry tRNA genes. Prophage integration into protein coding sequences can lead to either gene disruption or new proteins. The phage repressor, immunity and lysogenic conversion genes are frequently transcribed from the prophage. The expression of the latter is sometimes integrated into control circuits linking prophages, the lysogenic bacterium and its animal host. Prophages are apparently as easily acquired as they are lost from the bacterial chromosome. Fixation of prophage genes seems to be restricted to those with functions that have been co-opted by the bacterial host.},

Phage release and cell lysis already occur during early stages of static incubation. A mutant devoid of the prophages was significantly less prone to lysis in pure culture.

	abstract = {It has been argued that bacterial cells may use their temperate viruses as biological weapons. For instance, a few bacterial cells among a population of lysogenic cells could release the virus and kill susceptible non-lysogenic competitors, while their clone mates would be immune. Because viruses replicate inside their victims upon infection, this process would amplify their number in the arena. Sometimes, however, temperate viruses spare recipient cells from death by establishing themselves in a dormant state inside cells. This phenomenon is called lysogenization and, for some viruses such as the ? virus, the probability of lysogenization increases with the multiplicity of infection. Therefore, the amplification of viruses leads to conflicting predictions about the efficacy of temperate viruses as biological weapons: amplification can increase the relative advantage of clone mates of lysogens but also the likelihood of saving susceptible cells from death, because the probability of lysogenization is higher. To test the usefulness of viruses as biological weapons, we performed competition experiments between lysogenic Escherichia coli cells carrying the ? virus and susceptible ?-free E. coli cells, either in a structured or unstructured habitat. In structured and sometimes in unstructured habitats, the ? virus qualitatively behaved as a replicating toxin. However, such toxic effect of ? viruses ceased after a few days of competition. This was due to the fact that many of initially susceptible cells became lysogenic. Massive lysogenization of susceptible cells occurred precisely under the conditions where the amplification of the virus was substantial. From then on, these cells and their descendants became immune to the ? virus. In conclusion, if at short term bacterial cells may use temperate viruses as biological weapons, after a few days only the classical view of temperate bacterial viruses as parasitic agents prevails.},

They present unique problems for antibiotics and biocides, both due to the nature of the extracellular matrix and to the presence within the biofilm of metabolically inactive persister cells.

By contrast, bacteriophages seem to have a greater ability to target this common form of bacterial growth. The high numbers of bacteria present within biofilms actually facilitate the action of bacteriophages by allowing rapid and efficient infection of the host and consequent amplification of the bacteriophage. Bacteriophages also have a number of properties that make biofilms susceptible to their action. They are known to produce (or to be able to induce) enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. They are also able to infect persister cells, remaining dormant within them, but re-activating when they become metabolically active. Some cultured biofilms also seem better able to support the replication of bacteriophages than comparable planktonic systems. It is perhaps unsurprising that bacteriophages, as the natural predators of bacteria, have the ability to target this common form of bacterial life.},

Domestication of their components is thought to have endowed bacteria with molecular systems involved in secretion, defense, warfare, and gene transfer. However, the rates and mechanisms of domestication remain unknown. We used comparative genomics to study the evolution of prophages within the bacterial genome. We identified over 300 vertically inherited prophages within enterobacterial genomes. Some of these elements are very old and might predate the split between Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. The size distribution of prophage elements is bimodal, suggestive of rapid prophage inactivation followed by much slower genetic degradation. Accordingly, we observed a pervasive pattern of systematic counterselection of nonsynonymous mutations in prophage genes. Importantly, such patterns of purifying selection are observed not only on accessory regions but also in core phage genes, such as those encoding structural and lysis components. This suggests that bacterial hosts select for phage-associated functions. Several of these conserved prophages have gene repertoires compatible with described functions of adaptive prophage-derived elements such as bacteriocins, killer particles, gene transfer agents, or satellite prophages. We suggest that bacteria frequently domesticate their prophages. Most such domesticated elements end up deleted from the bacterial genome because they are replaced by analogous functions carried by new prophages. This puts the bacterial genome in a state of continuous flux of acquisition and loss of phage-derived adaptive genes.},

We examine how survival/reproduction trade-offs in viruses are affected by environmental stressors, proteins governing viral host range, and organization of the virus genome. Future studies incorporating comparative biology, experimental evolution, and structural biology, could thoroughly determine how viral trade-offs evolve, and whether they transiently or permanently constrain virus adaptation.},

	abstract = {The finding that total viral abundance is higher than total prokaryotic abundance and that a significant fraction of the prokaryotic community is infected with phages in aquatic systems has stimulated research on the ecology of prokaryotic viruses and their role in ecosystems. This review treats the ecology of prokaryotic viruses ('phages') in marine, freshwater and soil systems from a 'virus point of view'. The abundance of viruses varies strongly in different environments and is related to bacterial abundance or activity suggesting that the majority of the viruses found in the environment are typically phages. Data on phage diversity are sparse but indicate that phages are extremely diverse in natural systems. Lytic phages are predators of prokaryotes, whereas lysogenic and chronic infections represent a parasitic interaction. Some forms of lysogeny might be described best as mutualism. The little existing ecological data on phage populations indicate a large variety of environmental niches and survival strategies. The host cell is the main resource for phages and the resource quality, i.e., the metabolic state of the host cell, is a critical factor in all steps of the phage life cycle. Virus-induced mortality of prokaryotes varies strongly on a temporal and spatial scale and shows that phages can be important predators of bacterioplankton. This mortality and the release of cell lysis products into the environment can strongly influence microbial food web processes and biogeochemical cycles. Phages can also affect host diversity, e.g., by 'killing the winner' and keeping in check competitively dominant species or populations. Moreover, they mediate gene transfer between prokaryotes, but this remains largely unknown in the environment. Genomics or proteomics are providing us now with powerful tools in phage ecology, but final testing will have to be performed in the environment.},

	abstract = {Temperate phage genomes are highly variable mosaic collections of genes that infect a bacterial host, integrate into the host's genome or replicate as low copy number plasmids, and are regulated to switch from the lysogenic to lytic cycles to generate new virions and escape their host. Genomes from most Bacterial phyla contain at least one or more prophages. We updated our PhiSpy algorithm to improve detection of prophages and to provide a web-based framework for PhiSpy. We have used this algorithm to identify 36,488 prophage regions from 11,941 bacterial genomes, including almost 600 prophages with no known homology to any proteins. Transfer RNA genes were abundant in the prophages, many of which alleviate the limits of translation efficiency due to host codon bias and presumably enable phages to surpass the normal capacity of the hosts' translation machinery. We identified integrase genes in 15,765 prophages (43\% of the prophages). The integrase was routinely located at either end of the integrated phage genome, and was used to orient and align prophage genomes to reveal their underlying organization. The conserved genome alignments of phages recapitulate early, middle, and late gene order in transcriptional control of phage genes, and demonstrate that gene order, presumably selected by transcription timing and/or coordination among functional modules has been stably conserved throughout phage evolution.},

We identified 2246 prophages in complete bacterial genomes to study the genetic and life-history traits associated with lysogeny. While optimal growth temperatures and average cell volumes were not associated with lysogeny, prophages were more frequent in pathogens and in bacteria with small minimal doubling times. Their frequency also increased with genome size, but only for genomes smaller than 6?Mb. The number of spacers in CRISPR-Cas systems and the frequency of type III systems were anticorrelated with prophage frequency, but lysogens were more likely to encode type I and type II systems. The minimal doubling time was the trait most correlated with lysogeny, followed by genome size and pathogenicity. We propose that bacteria with highly variable growth rates often encounter lower opportunity costs for lysogeny relative to lysis. These results contribute to explain the paucity of temperate phages in certain bacterial clades and of bacterial lysogens in certain environments. They suggest that genetic and life-history traits affect the contributions of temperate phages to bacterial genomes.},

Analysis of the prophages suggested that after being integrated into bacterial genomes, they undergo a complex decay process consisting of inactivating point mutations, genome rearrangements, modular exchanges, invasion by further mobile {{DNA}} elements, and massive {{DNA}} deletion. We review the technical difficulties in defining such altered prophage sequences in bacterial genomes and discuss theoretical frameworks for the phage-bacterium interaction at the genomic level. The published genome sequences from three groups of eubacteria (low- and high-G+C gram-positive bacteria and ?-proteobacteria) were screened for prophage sequences. The prophages from Streptococcus pyogenes served as test case for theoretical predictions of the role of prophages in the evolution of pathogenic bacteria. The genomes from further human, animal, and plant pathogens, as well as commensal and free-living bacteria, were included in the analysis to see whether the same principles of prophage genomics apply for bacteria living in different ecological niches and coming from distinct phylogenetical affinities. The effect of selection pressure on the host bacterium is apparently an important force shaping the prophage genomes in low-G+C gram-positive bacteria and ?-proteobacteria.},

However, temperate phages can transfer genes, which can broaden their bacterial hosts metabolic repertoire, confer or enhance virulence, or eliminate competing organisms, and so enhance bacterial fitness. Recent evidence shows that phages can also promote biofilm formation leading to population-level benefits for their bacterial hosts. Here, we provide a perspective on the ecological and evolutionary consequences for the bacteria interacting with phages, when phage and host interests are aligned. Furthermore, we examine the question whether bacterial hosts can lower immune barriers to phage infection, thereby facilitating infection by beneficial phages. Taking recent evidence together, we suggest that in many cases temperate phages are to be considered as being mutualistic as well as parasitic, at the same time.},

The frequency and severity of GAS infections increased in the 1980s and 1990s, but the cause of this increase is unknown. Recently, genome sequencing of serotype M1, M3 and M18 strains revealed many new proven or putative virulence factors that are encoded by phages or phage-like elements. Importantly, these genetic elements account for an unexpectedly large proportion of the difference in gene content between the three strains. These new genome-sequencing studies have provided evidence that temporally and geographically distinct epidemics, and the complex array of GAS clinical presentations, might be related in part to the acquisition or evolution of phage-encoded virulence factors. We anticipate that new phage-encoded virulence factors will be identified by sequencing the genomes of additional GAS strains, including organisms non-randomly associated with particular clinical syndromes.},

Genomic islands whose functions increase bacterial fitness, either directly or indirectly, have most likely been positively selected and can be termed 'fitness islands'. Fitness islands can be divided into several subtypes: 'ecological islands' in environmental bacteria and 'saprophytic islands', 'symbiosis islands' or 'pathogenicity islands' (PAIs) in microorganisms that interact with living hosts.

The deduced amino acid sequence leads to a hypothetical polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 18.8 or 18.3 kDa, respectively. According to three hydrophobic regions, all of which are long enough to span the membrane, the product of sieA should be a protein of the inner membrane of a P22-lysogenic cell of Salmonella typhimurium. The SieA protein was moderately overproduced from an expression vector in cultures of Escherichia coli and could be recovered from the membrane fraction.},

	abstract = {Bacteriophages are realized to be numerous and important components of oceanic food webs principally because of their lytic capabilities. The subtle changes that temperate phages impart to their hosts in the oceans are far less understood. Occurrences of lysogeny in the oceans correlate well with conditions unfavorable for rapid host growth. In coliphage ?, phage encoded repressors have been shown to modulate host metabolic gene expression and phenotype, resulting in economizing host energy expenditure. Comparison of lysogenized marine bacteria to the uninfected hosts indicated that prophage acquisition is correlated with host metabolic gene suppression. Screening 113 marine bacterial genomes for prophages yielded 64 prophage-like elements, 21 of which strongly resembled gene transfer agents (GTAs). The remaining 39 putative prophages had a relatively high incidence of transcriptional regulatory and repressor-like proteins (~2/40 kb prophage sequence) compared to lytic marine phages (~0.25/40 kb phage sequence). Here, it has been hypothesized that marine prophages directly contribute to host survival in unfavorable environments by suppression of unneeded metabolic activities. It has been further suggested that such metabolic downshifts are the result of phage-encoded repressors and transcriptional regulators acting directly on host genes. Finally, the widespread occurrence of GTAs may be an efficient mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in the oceans.},

	abstract = {Prophage sequences constitute a substantial fraction of the temperate virus gene pool. Although subject to mutational decay, prophage sequences can also be an important source of adaptive mutations for these viral populations. Here we develop a life-history model for temperate viruses, including both the virulent (lytic) and the temperate phases of the life cycle. We then examine the survival of mutations that increase fitness during the lytic phase (attachment rate, burst size), increase fitness in the temperate phase (increasing host survival), or affect transitions between the two phases (integration or induction probability). We find that beneficial mutations are much more likely to survive, ultimately, if they first occur in the prophage state. This conclusion applies even to traits that are only expressed during the lytic phase, and arises due to the substantially lower variance in the offspring distribution during the temperate cycle. This observation, however, is balanced by the fact that many more mutations can be generated during lytic replication. Overall we predict that the prophage state provides a refuge, relatively shielded from genetic drift, in which temperate viruses can explore possible adaptive steps.},

Fitness costs associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are thought to constrain HGT, but our understanding of these costs remains fragmentary, making it difficult to predict the success of HGT events. Here we use the interaction between P. aeruginosa and a costly plasmid (pNUK73) to investigate the molecular basis of the cost of HGT. Using RNA-Seq, we show that the acquisition of pNUK73 results in a profound alteration of the transcriptional profile of chromosomal genes. Mutations that inactivate two genes encoded on chromosomally integrated MGEs recover these fitness costs and transcriptional changes by decreasing the expression of the pNUK73 replication gene. Our study demonstrates that interactions between MGEs can compromise bacterial fitness via altered gene expression, and we argue that conflicts between mobile elements impose a general constraint on evolution by HGT.},

SRB generate significant liabilities in the petroleum industry, mainly due to their ability to microbiologically induce corrosion, biofilm formation and H2S production. Bacteriophages are an alternative control method for SRB, whose information for this group of bacteria however, is scarce. The present study developed a workflow for the identification of complete prophages in Desulfovibrio. Poly-lysogenesis was shown to be common in Desulfovibrio. In the 47 genomes analyzed 53 complete prophages were identified. These were classified within the order Caudovirales, with 69.82\% belonging to the Myoviridade family. More than half the prophages identified have genes coding for lysozyme or holin. Four of the analyzed bacterial genomes present prophages with identity above 50\% in the same strain, whose comparative analysis demonstrated the existence of colinearity between the sequences. Of the 17 closed bacterial genomes analyzed, 6 have the CRISPR-Cas system classified as inactive. The identification of bacterial poly-lysogeny, the proximity between the complete prophages and the possible inactivity of the CRISPR-Cas in closed bacterial genomes analyzed allowed the choice of poly-lysogenic strains with prophages belonging to the Myoviridae family for the isolation of prophages and testing of related strains for subsequent studies.},

Understanding the evolutionary processes by which switches are tuned is central to understanding how phenotypic variation is realized. Prophage induction by phage lambda is the classic example of a genetic switch and allows lambda to move between two different modes of transmission: as a lysogen it reproduces vertically as a component of the host genome; as a free phage it reproduces horizontally by infectious epidemic spread. We show that the lambda switch can respond rapidly to selection for alteration in sensitivity and threshold. Sequencing of candidate genes in the genetic circuitry underlying the switch revealed mutations of likely adaptive significance in some, but not all candidates, suggesting that the core genetic circuitry plays a limited role in the fine-tuning of the switch in vivo. The relative ease with which the switch could be tuned by selection was further indicated by extensive variation in sensitivity and threshold of its response function among wild lambdoid phages. Together, our findings emphasize the adaptive significance of a finely tuned switch and draw attention to the selective factors shaping prophage induction in natural phage populations.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae has increased worldwide by the spread of a few clones. Fluoroquinolone resistance occurs mainly by alteration of their intracellular targets, the type II {{DNA}} topoisomerases, which is acquired either by point mutation or by recombination. Increase in fluoroquinolone-resistance may depend on the balance between antibiotic consumption and the cost that resistance imposes to bacterial fitness. In addition, pneumococcal prophages could play an important role. Prophage induction by fluoroquinolones was confirmed in 4 clinical isolates by using Southern blot hybridization. Clinical isolates (105 fluoroquinolone-resistant and 160 fluoroquinolone-susceptible) were tested for lysogeny by using a PCR assay and functional prophage carriage was studied by mitomycin C induction. Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains harbored fewer inducible prophages (17/43) than fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains (49/70) (P?=?0.0018). In addition, isolates of clones associated with fluoroquinolone resistance [CC156 (3/25); CC63 (2/20), and CC81 (1/19)], had lower frequency of functional prophages than isolates of clones with low incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance [CC30 (4/21), CC230 (5/20), CC62 (9/21), and CC180 (21/30)]. Likewise, persistent strains from patients with chronic respiratory diseases subjected to fluoroquinolone treatment had a low frequency of inducible prophages (1/11). Development of ciprofloxacin resistance was tested with two isogenic strains, one lysogenic and the other non-lysogenic: emergence of resistance was only observed in the non-lysogenic strain. These results are compatible with the lysis of lysogenic isolates receiving fluoroquinolones before the development of resistance and explain the inverse relation between presence of inducible prophages and fluoroquinolone-resistance.},

	abstract = {Background. How host-symbiont interactions coevolve between mutualism and parasitism depends on the ecology of the system and on the genetic and physiological constraints of the organisms involved. Theory often predicts that greater reliance on horizontal transmission favors increased costs of infection and may result in more virulent parasites or less beneficial mutualists. We set out to understand transitions between parasitism and mutualism by evolving the filamentous bacteriophage M13 and its host Escherichia coli. Results. The effect of phage M13 on bacterial fitness depends on the growth environment, and initial assays revealed that infected bacteria reproduce faster and to higher density than uninfected bacteria in 96-well microplates. These data suggested that M13 is, in fact, a facultative mutualist of E. coli. We then allowed E. coli and M13 to evolve in replicated environments, which varied in the relative opportunity for horizontal and vertical transmission of phage in order to assess the evolutionary stability of this mutualism. After 20 experimental passages, infected bacteria from treatments with both vertical and horizontal transmission of phage had evolved the fastest growth rates. At the same time, phage from these treatments no longer benefited the ancestral bacteria. Conclusions. These data suggest a positive correlation between the positive effects of M13 on E. coli hosts from the same culture and the negative effects of the same phage toward the ancestral bacterial genotype. The results also expose flaws in applying concepts from the virulence-transmission tradeoff hypothesis to mutualism evolution. We discuss the data in the context of more recent theory on how horizontal transmission affects mutualisms and explore how these effects influence phages encoding virulence factors in pathogenic bacteria.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY
            
              Strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, particularly those that are multiresistant, are an increasing major health care problem around the world. It is now abundantly clear that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are able to meet the evolutionary challenge of combating antimicrobial chemotherapy, often by acquiring preexisting resistance determinants from the bacterial gene pool. This is achieved through the concerted activities of mobile genetic elements able to move within or between DNA molecules, which include insertion sequences, transposons, and gene cassettes/integrons, and those that are able to transfer between bacterial cells, such as plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Together these elements play a central role in facilitating horizontal genetic exchange and therefore promote the acquisition and spread of resistance genes. This review aims to outline the characteristics of the major types of mobile genetic elements involved in acquisition and spread of antibiotic resistance in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, focusing on the so-called ESKAPEE group of organisms (

	abstract = {Integration of bacteriophage P2 into the Escherichia coli genome involves recombination between two attachment sites, attP and attB, one on the phage and one on the host genome, respectively. At least 10 different attB sites have been identified over the years. In E. coli C, one site, called locI, is preferred, being occupied before any of the others. In E. coli K-12, no such preference is seen (reviewed in L. E. Bertani and E. W. Six, p. 73-143, in R. Calendar, ed., The Bacteriophages, vol. 2, 1988). The DNA sequence of locI has been determined, and it shows a core sequence of 27 nucleotides identical to attP (A. Yu, L. E. Bertani, and E. Haggård-Ljungquist, Gene 80:1-12, 1989). By inverse polymerase chain reactions, the prophage-host junctions of DNA extracted from P2 lysogenic strains have been amplified, cloned, and sequenced. By combining the attL and attR sequences, the attB sequences of locations II, III, and H have been deduced. The core sequence of location II had 20 matches to the 27-nucleotide core sequence of attP; the sequences of locations III and H had 17 matches. Thus, the P2 integrase accepts at least up to 37\% mismatches within the core sequence. The E. coli K-12 strains examined all contain a 639-nucleotide-long cryptic remnant of P2 at a site with a sequence similar to that of locI but that may have a different map position. The P2 remnant consists of the C-terminal part of gene D, all of gene ogr, and attR. Locations II, III, and H have been located on Kohara's physical map to positions 3670, 1570 to 1575, and 2085, respectively.},

 abstract = {We have compared the process of prophage ? induction with that of prophage Mu. According to the Campbell model, rescue of ? {{DNA}} from the host {{DNA}} involves reversal of ? integration such that the prophage {{DNA}} is excised from the host chromosome. We have monitored this event by locating the prophage {{DNA}} with a technique in which {{DNA}} of the lysogenic cells is cleaved with a restriction endonuclease and fractionated in agarose gels. The {{DNA}} fragments are denatured in gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose paper, and hybridized with 32P-labeled mature phage {{DNA}}. The fragments containing prophage {{DNA}} become visible after autoradiography. Upon prophage ? induction, the phage-host junction fragments disappear and the fragment containing the ? att site appears. No such excision is seen in prophage Mu. The Mu-host junction fragments remain intact well into the lytic cycle, when Mu {{DNA}} has undergone many rounds of replication and apparently many copies of Mu {{DNA}} have been integrated into the host {{DNA}}. Therefore, we postulate that Mu {{DNA}} replicates in situ and that the replication generates a form of Mu {{DNA}} active in the integrative recombination between Mu {{DNA}} and host {{DNA}}. This type of mechanism may be common to many transposable elements.},

            Identifying active prophages is critical for studying coevolution of phage and bacteria, investigating phage physiology and biochemistry, and engineering designer phages for diverse applications. We present Prophage Hunter, a tool aimed at hunting for active prophages from whole genome assembly of bacteria. Combining sequence similarity-based matching and genetic features-based machine learning classification, we developed a novel scoring system that exhibits higher accuracy than current tools in predicting active prophages on the validation datasets. The option of skipping similarity matching is also available so that there's higher chance for novel phages to be discovered. Prophage Hunter provides a one-stop web service to extract prophage genomes from bacterial genomes, evaluate the activity of the prophages, identify phylogenetically related phages, and annotate the function of phage proteins. Prophage Hunter is freely available at https://pro-hunter.bgi.com/.},

	abstract = {The majority of biomass within water distribution systems is in the form of attached biofilm. This is known to be central to drinking water quality degradation following treatment, yet little understanding of the dynamics of these highly heterogeneous communities exists. This paper presents original information on such dynamics, with findings demonstrating patterns of material accumulation, seasonality, and influential factors. Rigorous flushing operations repeated over a 1-year period on an operational chlorinated system in the United Kingdom are presented here. Intensive monitoring and sampling were undertaken, including time-series turbidity and detailed microbial analysis using 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The results show that bacterial dynamics were influenced by differences in the supplied water and by the material remaining attached to the pipe wall following flushing. Turbidity, metals, and phosphate were the main factors correlated with the distribution of bacteria in the samples. Coupled with the lack of inhibition of biofilm development due to residual chlorine, this suggests that limiting inorganic nutrients, rather than organic carbon, might be a viable component in treatment strategies to manage biofilms. The research also showed that repeat flushing exerted beneficial selective pressure, giving another reason for flushing being a viable advantageous biofilm management option. This work advances our understanding of microbiological processes in drinking water distribution systems and helps inform strategies to optimize asset performance.
IMPORTANCE This research provides novel information regarding the dynamics of biofilm formation in real drinking water distribution systems made of different materials. This new knowledge on microbiological process in water supply systems can be used to optimize the performance of the distribution network and to guarantee safe and good-quality drinking water to consumers.},

In the guise of phage therapy they have been used for decades to successfully treat what are probable biofilm-containing chronic bacterial infections. More recently, phage treatment or biocontrol of biofilm bacteria has been brought back to the laboratory for more rigorous assessment as well as towards the use of phages to combat environmental biofilms, ones other than those directly associated with bacterial infections. Considered in a companion article is the inherent ecological utility of bacteriophages versus antibiotics as anti-biofilm agents. Discussed here is a model for phage ecological interaction with bacteria as they may occur across biofilm-containing ecosystems. Specifically, to the extent that individual bacterial types are not highly abundant within biofilm-containing environments, then phage exploitation of those bacteria may represent a "Feast-or-famine" existence in which infection of highly localized concentrations of phage-sensitive bacteria alternate with treacherous searches by the resulting phage progeny virions for new concentrations of phage-sensitive bacteria to infect. An updated synopsis of the literature concerning laboratory testing of phage use to combat bacterial biofilms is then provided along with tips on how "Ecologically" such phage-mediated biofilm control can be modified to more reliably achieve anti-biofilm efficacy.},

Understanding the interplay between phenotypic and genetic resistance mechanisms acting on biofilms, as well as appreciating the diversity of environmental conditions of biofilm infections which influence the effect of antibiotics are required in order to optimize the antibiotic treatment of biofilm infections. Here, we review the current knowledge on phenotypic and genetic resistance in biofilms and describe the potential strategies for the antibiotic treatment of biofilm infections. Of note is the optimization of PK/PD parameters in biofilms, high-dose topical treatments, combined and sequential/alternate therapies or the use antibiotic adjuvants.},

However, bacteria in natural environments usually form communities of surface-adherent organisms embedded in an extracellular matrix, called biofilms. Current antimicrobial strategies often fail to control bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth. Treatment failure is particularly frequent in association with intracorporeal or transcutaneous medical devices and compromised host immunity. The rising prevalence of these risk factors over the last decades has paralleled the increase in biofilm infections. This review discusses the shortcomings of current therapies against biofilms both in theory and with clinical examples.

	abstract = {Antibiotic-resistant isolates of Salmonella enterica were selected on plates containing lethal concentrations of rifampicin, kanamycin, and nalidixic acid. The stability of the resistance phenotype was scored after nonselective growth. Rifampicin-resistant (Rif(r)) isolates were stable, suggesting that they had arisen by mutation. Mutations in the rpoB gene were detected indeed in Rif(r) mutants. In contrast, a fraction of kanamycin-resistant (Km(r)) and nalidixic acid-resistant (Nal(r)) isolates showed reduced resistance after nonselective growth, suggesting that mechanisms other than mutation had contributed to bacterial survival upon lethal selection. Single-cell analysis revealed heterogeneity in expression of the porin gene ompC, and subpopulation separation provided evidence that reduced ompC expression confers adaptive resistance to kanamycin. In the case of Nal(r) isolates, mutations in the gyrA gene were present in most nalidixic acid-resistant isolates. However, the efflux pump inhibitor Phe-Arg-ß-naphtylamide (PAßN) reduced the level of resistance in Nal(r) mutants, indicating that active efflux contributes to the overall level of nalidixic acid resistance. Heterogeneous efflux pump activity was detected in single cells and colonies, and a correlation between high efflux and increased resistance to nalidixic acid was found. These observations suggest that fluctuations in the expression and the activity of critical functions of the bacterial cell, alone or combined with mutations, can contribute to adaptive resistance to antibiotics.},

Since as much as 80\% of human bacterial infections are biofilm-associated, many researchers have begun investigating therapies that specifically target the biofilm architecture, thereby dispersing the microbial cells into their more vulnerable, planktonic mode of life. This review addresses the current state of research into medical biofilm dispersal. We focus on three major classes of dispersal agents: enzymes (including proteases, deoxyribonucleases, and glycoside hydrolases), antibiofilm peptides, and dispersal molecules (including dispersal signals, anti-matrix molecules, and sequestration molecules). Throughout our discussion, we provide detailed lists and summaries of some of the most prominent and extensively researched dispersal agents that have shown promise against the biofilms of clinically relevant pathogens, and we catalog which specific microorganisms they have been shown to be effective against. Lastly, we discuss some of the main hurdles to development of biofilm dispersal agents, and contemplate what needs to be done to overcome them.},

Previous in vitro and in vivo studies revealed a significant inhibition of P. aeruginosa QS by crude garlic extract. By bioassay-guided fractionation of garlic extracts, we determined the primary QS inhibitor present in garlic to be ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound with potential as an antipathogenic drug. By comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies, the effect of synthetic ajoene toward P. aeruginosa was elucidated. DNA microarray studies of ajoene-treated P. aeruginosa cultures revealed a concentration-dependent attenuation of a few but central QS-controlled virulence factors, including rhamnolipid. Furthermore, ajoene treatment of in vitro biofilms demonstrated a clear synergistic, antimicrobial effect with tobramycin on biofilm killing and a cease in lytic necrosis of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, in a mouse model of pulmonary infection, a significant clearing of infecting P. aeruginosa was detected in ajoene-treated mice compared to a nontreated control group.

Hence, controlling pathogenic biofilm formation is important in bacteria-related diseases. Honey, at a low concentration of 0.5\% (v/v), significantly reduced biofilm formation in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 without inhibiting the growth of planktonic cells. Conversely, this concentration did not inhibit commensal E. coli K-12 biofilm formation. Transcriptome analyses showed that honey significantly repressed curli genes (csgBAC), quorum sensing genes (AI-2 importer and indole biosynthesis), and virulence genes (LEE genes). Glucose and fructose in the honeys were found to be key components in reducing biofilm formation by E. coli O157:H7 through the suppression of curli production and AI-2 import. Furthermore, honey, glucose and fructose decreased the colonization of E. coli O157:H7 cells on human HT-29 epithelial cells. These results suggest that low concentrations of honey, such as in honeyed water, can be a practical means for reducing the colonization and virulence of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7.},

AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Published patents relating to biofilm-active agents were identified in SciFinder(®) for the period January 2005 through March 2010 and representative patents selected with an emphasis on agents claimed for the prophylaxis or treatment of bacterial biofilm infections.
WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The review provides a basic understanding of the medical challenges posed by biofilm-associated infections, and summarizes claims describing novel therapeutic approaches in the management of biofilm infections.
TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Treatment of biofilm-associated infections with existing approved therapies remains a significant medical challenge. In the near term, new agents demonstrating bactericidal activity against bacteria within biofilms will be most readily incorporated into existing treatment paradigms. Alternative approaches that impact biofilm formation or dispersion are promising, but remain to be validated clinically.},

	volume = {9},
	issn = {1873-4316},
	abstract = {Biofilm formation occurs spontaneously on both inert and living systems and is an important bacterial survival strategy. In humans biofilms are responsible for many pathologies, most of them associated with the use of medical devices. A major problem of biofilms is their inherent tolerance to host defences and antibiotic therapies; there is therefore an urgent need to develop alternative ways to prevent and control biofilm-associated clinical infections. Several in vitro experiments have shown that phages are able to infect biofilm cells and that those phages inducing the production of depolymerases have an advantage since they can penetrate the inner layers of the biofilm by degrading components of the biofilm exopolymeric matrix. In practice clinically relevant biofilms and especially those associated with the use of medical devices can possibly be controlled for example by the topic application or the impregnation of the surface of the device with a phage solution. Another interesting approach has been the use of a phage encoding a phage polysaccharide lyase to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in cystic fibrosis patients by aerosol administration. All these strategies require prior identification of the phage and/or polysaccharide depolymerase capable of infecting the bacterial cells and degrading the polysaccharide within the biofilm, respectively. The biofilm organisms must therefore be isolated and screened against a bank of phages. This procedure is essential and raises important biotechnological challenges: the existence of a bank of phages well characterised (physiologically and genetically) whose efficacy in vivo has been tested and pharmacokinetics studied; the existence of economical and safe production protocols and purification methods (e.g. the presence of endotoxins in a phage preparation may compromise phage therapy). It is however important to consider the fact that the chances of getting a specific phage with a high lytic capability and preferential expressing a relevant exopolymer degrading enzyme is likely to be low. Genetically engineered phages can play an important role in this process. Phages can be genetically manipulated to alter their host range and to induce the production of depolymerases. It is therefore important to reinforce the application of synthetic biology to engineer phages able to efficiently degrade medical biofilms. It is also important to develop efficient methods of phage delivery and to study "in vivo" the phage performance against biofilms. It is still not clear how effective the biofilm can be in protecting the phages against the immune system. Efficient and economic phage production and purification protocols need also to be addressed before one can hope to use phage treatment to prevent or control infectious biofilms.},

Antibiotics as anti-biofilm agents can, by contrast, be inefficacious against even genetically sensitive targets. Such deficiencies in usefulness may result from antibiotics, as naturally occurring compounds, not serving their producers, in nature, as stand-alone disruptors of mature biofilms. Anti-biofilm effectiveness by phages, by contrast, may result from a combination of inherent abilities to concentrate lytic antibacterial activity intracellularly via bacterial infection and extracellularly via localized population growth. Considered here is the anti-biofilm activity of microorganisms, with a case presented for why, ecologically, bacteriophages can be more efficacious than traditional antibiotics as medically or environmentally applied biofilm-disrupting agents. Four criteria, it can be argued, generally must be met, in combination, for microorganisms to eradicate biofilms: (1) Furnishing of sufficiently effective antibacterial factors, (2) intimate interaction with biofilm bacteria over extended periods, (3) associated ability to concentrate antibacterial factors in or around targets, and, ultimately, (4) a means of physically disrupting or displacing target bacteria. In nature, lytic predators of bacteria likely can meet these criteria whereas antibiotic production, in and of itself, largely may not.},

Given that the mechanisms of killing differ profoundly between drugs and phages, an obvious question is whether killing is improved by combining antibiotic and phage therapy. However, this question has only recently begun to be explored. Here, in vitro biofilm populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 were treated singly and with combinations of two phages and bactericidal antibiotics of five classes. By themselves, phages and drugs commonly had only modest effects in killing the bacteria. However some phage-drug combinations reduced bacterial densities to well below that of the best single treatment; in some cases, bacterial densities were reduced even below the level expected if both agents killed independently of each other (synergy). Furthermore, there was a profound order effect in some cases: treatment with phages before drugs achieved maximum killing. Combined treatment was particularly effective in killing in Pseudomonas biofilms grown on layers of cultured epithelial cells. Phages were also capable of limiting the extent to which minority populations of bacteria resistant to the treating antibiotic ascend. The potential of combined antibiotic and phage treatment of biofilm infections is discussed as a realistic way to evaluate and establish the use of bacteriophage for the treatment of humans.},

The key feature of the model is the use of a inhibition function to relate substrate concentration and specific growth rate. Simulation studies show that the primary result of inhibition by substrate in a batch culture is an increase in the lag time whereas in continuous culture inhibition by substrate may result in process instability. The model should be of value in investigations of the stability of biological processes used for the treatment of certain industrial wastes such as those containing phenols, thiocyanates, nitrates, ammonia, volatile acids, etc., which are known to be inhibitory to many of the organisms metabolizing them.},

We show that in this case there exists a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation point of codimension 3, which acts as an organizing center for the system. We study the Hopf and homoclinic bifurcations and saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles of the system. We also describe the bifurcation sequences in each subregion of parameter space as the death rate of the predator is varied. In contrast with the case \$b {\textbackslash}geq 0\$, we prove that when \$-2{\textbackslash}sqrt a {\textless} b {\textless} 0\$, a limit cycle can coexist with a homoclinic loop. The bifurcation sequences involving Hopf bifurcations, homoclinic bifurcations, as well as the saddle-node bifurcations of limit cycles are determined using information from the complete study of the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation point of codimension 3 and the geometry of the system. Examples of the predicted bifurcation curves are also generated numerically using XPPAUT. Our work extends the results in [F. Rothe and D. S. Shafer, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect.

	abstract = {The potential application of phage therapy for the control of bacterial biofilms has received increasing attention as resistance to conventional antibiotic agents continues to increase. The present study identifies antimicrobial synergy between bacteriophage T4 and a conventional antibiotic, cefotaxime, via standard plaque assay and, importantly, in the in vitro eradication of biofilms of the T4 host strain Escherichia coli 11303. Phage-antibiotic synergy (PAS) is defined as the phenomenon whereby sub-lethal concentrations of certain antibiotics can substantially stimulate the host bacteria's production of virulent phage. Increasing sub-lethal concentrations of cefotaxime resulted in an observed increase in T4 plaque size and T4 concentration. The application of PAS to the T4 one-step growth curve also resulted in an increased burst size and reduced latent period. Combinations of T4 bacteriophage and cefotaxime significantly enhanced the eradication of bacterial biofilms when compared to treatment with cefotaxime alone. The addition of medium (104 PFU mL-1) and high (107 PFU mL-1) phage titres reduced the minimum biofilm eradication concentration value of cefotaxime against E. coli 
ATCC 11303 biofilms from 256 to 128 and 32 µg mL-1, respectively. Although further investigation is needed to confirm PAS, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that synergy between bacteriophage and conventional antibiotics can significantly improve biofilm control in vitro.},

Bacteriophages specific for Enterobacter strains were isolated from primary effluent sewage. Combinations of three phages were required before complete eradication of single species biofilms of Enterobacter cloace occurred. Attempts to eliminate a susceptible bacterial population within a dual species biofilm were unsuccessful. It was thought that the structural heterogeneity of the biofilm produced pockets of unattainable, susceptible bacteria. These results suggest that phage and bacteria can co-exist stably within a biofilm. Bacteriophage, would, therefore, make poor tools for the control of biofilm formation. However, the results suggest that combined treatment with bacteriophage polysaccharide depolymerases and disinfectant may provide an alternative control strategy.},

Comparisons of electron micrographs with scanning confocal laser microscope (SCLM) images indicated that single RITC-labeled phage particles could be visualized. Biofilms of each bacterium were infected by labeled phage. SCLM and epifluorescence microscopy were used to observe adsorption of phage to single-layer surface-attached bacteria and thicker biofilms. The spread of the recombinant T4 phage, YZA1 (containing an rII-LacZ fusion), within a lac E. coli biofilm could be detected in the presence of chromogenic and fluorogenic homologs of galactose. Infected cells exhibited blue pigmentation and fluorescence from the cleavage products produced by the phage-encoded beta-galactosidase activity. Fluorescent antibodies were used to detect non-labeled progeny phage. Phage T4 infected both surface-attached and surface-associated E. coli while phage E79 adsorbed to P. aeruginosa cells on the surface of the biofilm, but access to cells deep in biofilms was somewhat restricted. Temperature and nutrient concentration did not affect susceptibility to phage infection, but lower temperature and low nutrients extended the time-to-lysis and slowed the spread of infection within the biofilm.},

Explicit conditions on the system parameters are derived which can be used to determine the number of Hopf bifurcations, the stability of bifurcating limit cycles, and the parameter regime where the bistable or tristable phenomenon occurs.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT
            Based on modern microbiology, we propose a major revision in current space exploration philosophy and planetary protection policy, especially regarding microorganisms in space. Mainly, microbial introduction should not be considered accidental but inevitable. We hypothesize the near impossibility of exploring new planets without carrying and/or delivering any microbial travelers. In addition, although we highlight the importance of controlling and tracking such contaminations—to explore the existence of extraterrestrial microorganisms—we also believe that we must discuss the role of microbes as primary colonists and assets, rather than serendipitous accidents, for future plans of extraterrestrial colonization. This paradigm shift stems partly from the overwhelming evidence of microorganisms’ diverse roles in sustaining life on Earth, such as symbioses and ecosystem services (decomposition, atmosphere effects, nitrogen fixation, etc.). Therefore, we propose a framework for new discussion based on the scientific implications of future colonization and terraforming: (i) focus on methods to track and avoid accidental delivery of Earth's harmful microorganisms and genes to extraterrestrial areas; (ii) begin a rigorous program to develop and explore ‘Proactive Inoculation Protocols’. We outline a rationale and solicit feedback to drive a public and private research agenda that optimizes diverse organisms for potential space colonization.},

	abstract = {Bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics. Even without changing genetically, bacteria also can display tolerance to antibiotic treatments. Many antibiotics are also broadly acting, as can result in excessive modifications of body microbiomes. Particularly for antibiotics of last resort or in treating extremely ill patients, antibiotics furthermore can display excessive toxicities. Antibiotics nevertheless remain the standard of care for bacterial infections, and rightly so given their long track records of both antibacterial efficacy and infrequency of severe side effects. Antibiotics do not successfully cure all treated bacterial infections, however, thereby providing a utility to alternative antibacterial approaches. One such approach is the use of bacteriophages, the viruses of bacteria. This nearly 100-year-old bactericidal, anti-infection technology can be effective against antibiotic-resistant or -tolerant bacteria, including bacterial biofilms and persister cells. Ideally phages could be used in combination with standard antibiotics while retaining their anti-bacterial pharmacodynamic activity, this despite antibiotics interfering with aspects of bacterial metabolism that are also required for full phage infection activity. Here I examine the literature of pre-clinical phage-antibiotic combination treatments, with emphasis on antibiotic-susceptible bacterial targets. I review evidence of antibiotic interference with phage infection activity along with its converse: phage antibacterial functioning despite antibiotic presence.},
