\section{Sensitivity Analysis}
\subsection{Sensitivity to the smallest autonomous phage length.}\label{bob30}
We tested fitting model (\ref{pde}) to Data Set 1, but assuming that the smallest autonomous phage to infect \textit{E.~Coli} and \textit{S.~Enterica} has length $\theta$ = 30 kb, as suggested in \cite{bobay_pervasive_2014}. We compared these results to results obtained with $\theta$ = 20 kb, as described in Section 2.2 of the main text. Figure~\ref{fig:comp_PDF} demonstrates that our results are insensitive to the choice of this parameter.

\subsection{Rate parameters}

We performed a bootstrap sensitivity analysis for all parameters of the model using Data Set 1.  In brief, we assumed that the best fit model for Data Set 1 represented the true distribution, and resampled this true distribution 335 times, each time creating a simulated data set of 624 observed prophage lengths.  We then subjected each of these data sets to the model fitting exercise described in Section 3 of the main text.  Table \ref{table:sens_p} shows the mean and standard deviations for the relative rate parameters of the model (each rate normalized by the induction rate, $r_I$), after the analysis of 335 simulated data sets.  These results indicate that the quantitative conclusions of our work are relatively insensitive to variations in data sampling; the coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean) of the degradation rate is largest at 16\%.

\subsection [Influx of active phage]{Influx of active phage, $f(x)$}

In addition, this process produced 335 estimates of the influx distribution $f(x)$.  In Figure \ref{fig:sens_f}, we plot the mean of these functions at every value of $x$ (blue line), plus/minus one standard deviation (grey area).  The best fit $f(x)$ from Data Set 1 is also shown for comparison (red line).  These results indicate that the form of $f(x)$ is very tightly constrained by the data, a result that is perhaps not surprising given the large number of data points.
